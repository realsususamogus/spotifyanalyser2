## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Spotify Developer Account**: You'll need to create a Spotify app to get API credentials
   - Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Create a new app
   - Note your Client ID and Client Secret
   - Add redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/callback` (for local development)

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd spotifyanalyser2
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` file with your Spotify credentials:
   ```
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
   PORT=3000
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Deployment on Render

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account

2. **Create a new Web Service** on [Render](https://render.com):
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Use the following settings:
     - **Build Command**: `npm install`
     - **Start Command**: `npm start`

3. **Set Environment Variables** in Render dashboard:
   - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`: Your Spotify Client ID
   - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Spotify Client Secret
   - `REDIRECT_URI`: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/callback`

4. **Update Spotify App Settings**:
   - Go to your Spotify app in the Developer Dashboard
   - Add your Render URL to the Redirect URIs: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/callback`

5. **Deploy** - Render will automatically deploy your app

## How It Works

1. **Authentication**: Users log in with their Spotify account using OAuth 2.0
2. **Playlist Fetching**: The app fetches the user's playlists from Spotify API
3. **Data Analysis**: For each selected playlist, the app:
   - Fetches detailed track information
   - Retrieves audio features for all tracks
   - Analyzes patterns and calculates statistics
4. **Visualization**: Results are displayed with progress bars, charts, and statistics

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main application page
- `GET /auth/login` - Initiate Spotify OAuth flow
- `GET /callback` - OAuth callback endpoint
- `POST /api/playlists` - Fetch user's playlists
- `POST /api/analyze-playlist` - Analyze specific playlist
